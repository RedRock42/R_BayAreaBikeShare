## R_Linear Regression Project-- Kaggle_Bay Area Bike Share Analysis

This folder contains files for the Bay Area Bike Share Analysis.

Goal of Project: 
For this project I used the Bike Sharing Demand Kaggle dataset to explore and create a linear regression model using R. The primary goal of the project was to get comfortable with Exploratory Data Anyalysis using R in addition to gaining an understanding of why certain models are not a good choice for a dataset. 

## Data Fields
You are provided hourly rental data spanning two years. For this competition, the training set is comprised of the first 19 days of each month, while the test set is the 20th to the end of the month. You must predict the total count of bikes rented during each hour covered by the test set, using only information available prior to the rental period.

    Data Fields

    datetime - hourly date + timestamp  
    season -  1 = spring, 2 = summer, 3 = fall, 4 = winter 
    holiday - whether the day is considered a holiday
    workingday - whether the day is neither a weekend nor holiday
    weather - 1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy 
    2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist 
    3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds 
    4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog 
    temp - temperature in Celsius
    atemp - "feels like" temperature in Celsius
    humidity - relative humidity
    windspeed - wind speed
    casual - number of non-registered user rentals initiated
    registered - number of registered user rentals initiated
    count - number of total rentals
